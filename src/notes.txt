Start exploring for neighbors

do we always EXIT_FAILURE ??

after the recvfrom do we wait for the handle call or we create other process

emitate an attack where you take an id of others and send to every neighbor a goaway tlv

every 30 sec send a long hello to everyone in recent_neighbors list

check last hello time for everyone if > 2min send a goaway with code 2 and if non symetric move him to potential_neighbors else make him non symetric

every 2min send neighbor tlv

check for number of symetric neighbor if < 8 send long hello to potentials

if data is not inside data list, print it and forward to everyone except the sender. else send an ack

when ack is received delete the sender from the list

consider a data as an ack if the data already exists
